Potential problems with digital token transfer

1. intercept transfer and steal funds
2. spend money without authorization
3. double spend (digital currency can be replecated)
4. equivocate (make sure once a spend happens it cannot be taken back very easily)

features in digital cryptocurrency:
1. Anyone can use it --> Permissionless
2. Authoritative transfer (be sure when alice sends some cash it's really her)
--> no double spends
3. Can't undo spends --> tamper proof

banks keeps a database storing who is sending money to whom

Distributed consensus
1. problem of multiple computers agreeing on a value
2. used to build a log of operations with state machine replication
3. works as a distrubuted database

Byzantine fault tolerant distributed consensus
It tolerates actively malicious participants
But participants needs identity

Make identity costly

Also, don't want anyone in charge
rules out SSN, phone num, captchas
